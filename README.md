<b>Briefly explain the need for the app (the "what")</b> <br>
There are two applications that we are currently considering: (1) a queueing system for restaurants and  (2) a calorie counter for the dining halls. 

(1) This application is a queueing/waitlist + reservation + ordering system for restaurants. During busy hours, such as lunch or dinner time, it gets hectic in restaurants. People may be waiting in the restaurant while not being approached by the host for a while. A solution to this is to allow the  customers to do this themselves. Customers could scan a QR code and list the number of people in their party to automatically add themselves on the waitlist. While they are waiting, they could also look at the menu and order their food. When they have time, the restaurant could use their interface to notify their customers about the wait time. We could also implement a direct paying system so that customers donâ€™t have to wait for the waiters to come pick up their credit cards. 

(2) This application is a calorie counter for Tufts dining halls. When going to the dining halls, it is difficult to track the calories and nutrients of each food, especially during peak hours when you feel rushed to get your food to get the line moving. This app tries to solve this problem by using the camera to quickly scan QR code on the labels of each respective food to obtain and quickly tabulate the calories and nutrients of your meal. 

<b>List the stakeholders and customers of the apps (the "who")</b><br>
(1) The stakeholders are the restaurant owners, and the customers are the restaurant customers. 

(2) The customers of this app are primarily Tufts students and faculties. The stakeholders are Tufts dining halls and cafe. 

<b>Using wireframes, sketch the most important views of the app.</b><br>

<b>Diagram or sketch the architecture of the platform. The platform is what that powers the app. It is very difficult to build an app without any dependencies. </b><br>

<b>List and briefly describe the core functionality of the app, the most important functions and transactions of the app.</b><br>
(1) The core functionalities are scanning QR codes, reservation and queue databases. 

(2) Scanning QR codes, calculate calories. 

<b>List and briefly describe the secondary functionality of the app, the functions and transactions of the app that are nice to have only if time allows.</b><br>
(1) Money transaction API

(2) Recommend food based on user profile and goals. 

<b>List the features on a mobile device that the app will use (e.g., camera, GPS, SMS, flashlight).</b><br>
(1) This app will use the camera in order to scan QR codes. It may also use SMS to notify the user about wait times or when their table is ready 

(2) This app will primarily use just the camera. 

<b>Briefly describe any limitations each team member may feel that will hold back progress.</b><br>
(1) One limitation is the money transaction aspect of the app. We do not have any restaurants cooperating with us, and it would be difficult to test ordering food. 

(2) We have to let Tufts Dining give us their database and convert it to fit our system. As an alternative, we plan to scrape the menu online in order to get the data. Also, the food recommendation algorithm could be complicated. 


<b>Briefly describe how your team plans to market or advertise the app.</b><br>
(1) We could manually notify restaurant owners and try to convince them to use the app. We could also try to find a popular newsletter for restaurant owners or food lovers and try to advertise it there. 

(2)This app would be advertised through the dining halls, flyers throughout campus, or school newsletters.
