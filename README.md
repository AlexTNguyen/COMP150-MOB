Tired of having to wait at a restaurant because the host/hostess is nowhere to be seen? Do you work at a restaurant and find it hard to manage the seating for all your customers? With QueueR, these problems are easily solved! QueueR is a queuing system that restaurants can use to manage their customers. With the app, restaurant workers can view the wait list and set statuses (waiting, seated, finished) for each entry. The app organizes the list by status and wait time. Customers can add themselves to the wait list by scanning the restaurant's unique QR code. QueueR makes life easy for both restaurants and customers!
